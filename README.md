# My Portfolio verison 0.5
## Basically I was building this portfolio as I was checking other ideas of building portfolio. 
## This one featues:
* A **word cloud** that I did in Photoshop
* **Animated** landing section
* Tabs with **animated** slider
* Project cards with **3D hover effects**
### This is only a quick renew of my previous portfolio. I purposely did not componentize it to see how messy it can be and I really regret it. There are more features like intersectionObserver and svg scroll animation that I want to integrate in the future but it will need a total redesign.
